RCSwitch
========

This is a fork of [RCSwitch by Ernest314](https://github.com/Ernest314/RCSwitch) but for standalone usage without Spark.

For more information please go to the source repository. This repository only provides a multiple frequency receiving example using multiple modules (ReceiveDemo_Advanced_Multiple.ino). 

Wiring diagram can be checked out below:
